class TuringMachine(object):
    """ Nondeterministic turing machine interpreter.

        The states are represented by strings and the letters from the tape
        and input alphabet as numbers. In particular:
        - 0 denotes the blank symbol;
        - start denotes the initial state;
        - accept and reject denote the accepting and rejecting states.

        The machineâ€™s description is given as a list of its transitions. Each
        transition is written in a separate line in the following format:
        <current_state> <currently_seen_letter> <target_state>
        <letter_to_write> <direction>
        The machine accepts its input by entering the accept state.
        The machine rejects the input word by either:
        - entering the reject state
        - getting stuck -- entering a configuration for which there is no
        applicable transition
        - looping forever

        The Turing machine does not have to have/use the reject state.
        The machine first writes the output letter and then moves its head.
        The machine cannot move left in the first position -- if it tries to,
        it simply stays in place.
        The machine can output blanks.
        The tape alphabet is a subset of natural numbers. The input alphabet
        is a subset of {1..9} .
